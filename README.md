# Website Challenge

## Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

The person you are making your website for is your partner, aka The Client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what the client wants from a profile site, assess what information is available and useful, design what serves the audience of users (aka the other bootcampers) best from the experience, and then create something which best solves those needs. You won't be given any guidance of what to build - you'll need to empathise with your users to see what they would find useful (or even survey and talk to them), and plan your site accordingly.

## Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS
- a profile describing your client
- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

## Extra

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core skills of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website for a client, and have a user-centric approach - a key learning objective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with the client to find out everything you need in order to design and build a website which represents them to the rest of the cohort.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, there is nothing stopping you pair programming with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the bootcamp, and you will be given time in live evening sessions to work on it as well.

## HTML & CSS and Markdown

Things I have learnt about **HTML**:
1. The boilerplate code - what are the _essential_ must have's in any HTML document?
2. How to use opening and closing tags (and using just one tag for an inline element)
3. The _"Family Tree"_ of HTML - parent, child, sibling, ancestor etc.
4. HTML is what we use for the structure and order of the content of the page. 

Things I heave learnt about **CSS**
1. Whilst HTML is concerned with content, CSS is concerned with the **_styling_** of that content.
2. Selectors, properties, values 
3. How to set up classes and ids to target multiple areas of a webpage with a certain style (e.g. style all h1 elements in a certain way, or every time a date is written, style it in another way). 
4. Font familys and web safe fonts.
5. Borders, padding and margins 
6. Animations and transitions  
  
I've also learnt that my memory will not be able to recall everything that I've read, but I've started keeping a list of websites and places to go when I forget. Focussing on remembering where this info I need is kept rather than learning by rote. **Trying to remember the patterns**

## Flexbox / BEM / User design ##

In the second week I have been able to get much more creative with my coding, and decided to change the nav bar and content tables in my website to use flexboxes instead. I also later changed the footer to a flexbox too, as it was easier to format the text in the way I wanted. The format of my website also meant that I got used to changing the  **_flex direction_**, working with both the horizontal and vertical axis as the main/cross axis. 

After learning about BEM I refactored some of the code in my website. This seemed tricky at first, but once all the blocks and elements were in place it became much easier to write my CSS without looking back to the HTML as the block/element names made much more sense. 

I considered user design particularly in the colour scheme of my website, sending several possible options off to my pair partner based on what she said she liked, giving options worked well. I also considered visual hierarcy and white space after watching the tutorial. 

## Final Thoughts ##

- There is always something that I will want to change or think I can do better, especially on the bootcamp as we are always learning something new. 
- What I think looks great will not always be what the client wants! 
- Planning a layout first will help in the long run. 
- Commenting on my code will help me keep track of my thought process. 
- I need to work on understanding of how changing margins/padding/borders affects different elements, and also using the different units (px/em/rem/vh/vw). 
- I am really excited to see what I can produce in the next challenge, especially when we are able to us JS.
